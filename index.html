                In the age of 25 and 85, there is no more difference in Japaness.Age is just a number in Japan.They look always young and they have the same energy inolder
                The celebraties also follow their concepts for keep them fit and look like young and still remain young. </br>
            Did you hear about the word IKIGI? It is a mysterious word.Did you ever think what is the meaning of your life?Is the point
            just to live longer or should you seek a heigher purpose?Why do some people know what they want and have a passion for life,while others languish in confussion?</br>
            At some point in this conversation,the mysterious word IKIGAI came up.IKIGAI means the reason to jump out of bed each morning.Everyone should has an IKIGAI.It will give us energy for living.</br>
        <ul type="square"><b>The way you can get a happy and youthful life :-</b> </ul>
            <li><b>Only staying active will make you want to live for hundred years</b>
                The happiness is in always being busy.So always do something.Never spend any leisure time.Each day go for a walk,
                use your feet instead of an elevator,perticipate insocial activities,play with pets or children or join a sports team </br>
            Active mind,Youthful body.So always keep active your mind.But you should not do that things as you have always done them.The problem
            is that when the brain develops ingrained habits,it doesn't need to think anymore.Things get done quuickly and efficiently on automatic pilot,
            often in a very advantageous way.This creates a tendency to stick to routines and the only way of breaking these is to confront the brain
            with new information.You can try new books,read newspaper and analyse that or envolp in a research.</br>
            <li><b>Eat less to live longer and stay fit</b> .Fill your belly to 80%.Of course,there is no way to know objectively
                if your stomac is at 80% capacity.The lesson to learn from this saying is that we should stop eating when we are starting
                to feel full.The extra side dish,the snack we eat when we know in our hearts we don't really need it,the apple pie after lunch,
                all these will give us pleasure in the short term,but not having them will make us happier in the long term.You can hardly find one 
                Japaness who is fat and this is the reason.You may lose your weight but get a healthy and happy life.</br>
            <li> <b>People who maintain a low level of stress,who faced challenges and put their heart and soul into their work in order
            to succeed,lived longer than those who chose a more relaxed lifestyle and retired earlier</b> </br>
        <li><b>Get the right amount of sleep</b> </br> Because When we sleep,we generate melatonin,a hormone that occurs naturally in our bodies.
            Melatonin strengthens the immune system,it contains an element that protects againgst cancer,it slows the onset of Alzhemer's
            disease,it also helps prevent osteporosis and fight heart disease. </br>
            <li><b>Going with flow </b> </br> Imagine you are doing art,one of your favourite slopes.You are entirely focused on
            art as well as you can.You know exactly how to move your brush at each moment.There is no future,no past.Thre is only Present.You
            feel the paper,your brush,your body and your conciousness united as a single entity.You are completely immersed in experince,not 
            thinking about or distracted by anything else.Your ego dissolves and you become part of what you are doing.The opposite can also happen.
            When we have to complete a task we don't want to do,every minute feels like alifetime and we can't stop looking at our watch.As
            the quip attributed to Einstein goes,"Put your hand on a stove for a minute,it seems like an hour.Sit with a preety girl for an hour,it seems like a minute
        .That is Relativity" </br>
            <li> <b>Add a little something extra,something that takes you out of your comfort zone</b></br>.If you are a graphic designer,learn a new software for
            your next project.If you are a programmer,use a new programming language.If you are a dancer try yo incorporate into your next 
            routine a movement that has seemed impossible for years.Do something that has seemed impossible for other people. </br>
            <li><b>The things we love are like the leaves of a tree.</b></br> They can fall at ant moment with a gust of wind.So always
            live in present.This moment exists only now and won't come again.So we should enjoy the moment and not lose ourselves in worries about
            the past or the future. </br>
            <li><b>Creat more options.</b> </br> Instead of having a single salary,try to find a way to make money from your hobbies,
            at other jobs or by starting your own bussiness. </br>
            <li><b> Do Maditation or Youga </b>
